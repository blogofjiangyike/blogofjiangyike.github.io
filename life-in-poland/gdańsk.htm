      <p>I stayed in Gdańsk from December 9 to December 15, 2022.</p>
      <p>It is my first time to visit Europe. Since 2020, I have been very interested in the history and culture of Poland. However, my special impression of Poland should go back to the times of my student days.</p>
      <p>In 1995, it was the fiftieth anniversary after the end of the second world war. Every day I watched “Battleline”, an old American documentary released in 1963. My first impression of Poland was that Polish people were fearless. But the first impression should be caused by a misconception that Polish soldiers rode horses and attacked German tanks.</p>

      <p>My second impression of Poland was that Polish people had the great spirit of liberty. When I was a high school student in late 1990s, from my schoolbook of history I knew 1956 Poznań protests and Solidarność. In my postgraduate period, my schoolbook of politics detailedly told various branches of socialism and the transformation of Eastern Europe. The book mentioned that Wałęsa used the word “original sin” to criticize the system that originated from Russia.</p>

      <p>It should be the will of Heaven that Gdańsk became the first Polish city I stayed. I visited historic sites that I only read from books before. After I started to stay in Poland, my impression of Poland was going to be changed from fantasy to reality.</p>
      <p>Before I came here, my parents were worried about my safety. In China, people think that Poles are against Russia, so they might be unfriendly to Chinese because of geopolitical situation after Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>In fact, here people don’t care where you are from. Poles care about daily life like most of Chinese. In Gdańsk, I saw an interesting graffiti phenomenon. Someone wrote a political word on a wall, and another one wrote an opposed word that covered it. It shows the diversity of Polish society. It is unlikely that a diversified society could go towards extremism.</p>
