      <p>I stayed in Legnica from February 13 to February 20, 2023.</p>
      <p>I knew the Battle of Legnica from the PC game “Age of Empires IV”. In 1241, the troops of Poland and their allies faught against Mongolian horsemen in Legnica. Though European troops were defeated, Mongols didn’t march westwards. So Legnica was the westernmost city that Mongolian forces reached.</p>

      <p>The tragic history that Mongols conquered the Southern Song Dynasty can’t be a common memory of Han Chinese, but Poles have never forgotten Mongolian invasions of their nation. In a square of Legnica, there is a cross monument to the battle, especially to Henryk II who died as the commander of Polish troops in the battle. In Warsaw, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier also records the date of the battle. In Kraków, the highest tower of St. Mary’s Basilica plays a bugle call every hour on the hour in memory of a hero who was killed during he sounded an alarm to the entire city after he found the appearance of Mongolian troops.</p>
      <p>Though Poland is far from China, Poles and Han Chinese had some similar experiences in the past millennium. When I visited Polish historic sites, I stood silently, not only for Polish heroes, but also for Han Chinese heroes.</p>

      <p>I stayed in a cheap apartment located in the center of Legnica. When I stood at the window, I could see Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral. It is a quiet place, though there are a lot of apartment buildings. I enjoyed the quiet, and finished my translation of an ancient Chinese story from ancient Chinese to English. The story is from an ancient historical work named “Book of Han” and it is about the experiences of Li Ling and his five thousand foot soldiers who fought against the Huns. A dozen years ago I translated it but later the translation was lost. So I decided to translate again.</p>

      <p>In the east of the town, there is a large park. Every day I walked there after I found it. I am very impressed by the nature of Legnica. There are a lot of big trees that show the history of the park. And there are a lot of birds. I can imagine that there should a lot of squirrels in the summer. In the lake and the river, there are wild ducks and gulls. A mother took her child to feed the wild ducks. It is unimaginable in China. My hometown is by the Poyang Lake. Though the lake is famed for its habitats of water birds, I had never seen a living wild duck. People’s desire to eat wild animals and the destruction of natural environment make Chinese children have no chance to see flying ducks.</p>

      <p>On the east side of the river by the park, there is a large grassy field. Some people were chatting leisurely and their dogs were playing freely. I suddenly remembered an ancient Chinese story. Li Si was a powerful prime minister of the Qin Dynasty. Before he was killed, he said to his son, “I really would like to take a yellow dog with you and go to chase hares outside the eastern gate of our hometown again.” It was a dream life for common Chinese people. Now this kind of life is farther from us. Even in my hometown there are a lot of high buildings. The field where my grandfather liked to walk with me in my childhood has disappeared for a dozen years.</p>

      <p>In Legnica, I found an old cinema which seems to be disused. I remembered my hometown’s old cinema that no longer exists. Poles always keep old buidings and build new buildings in another area. But Chinese always demolish old buidings and building new buildings there. The primary school, the high school with the street, where I once studied and walked every day, were gone forever. In my childhood, on the steps of the cinema a lot of old people sat there and enjoyed sunshine; on both sides of the street to my schools, a lot of old people sold home-made goods in front of their houses. All disappeared. In Poland, people can see the places where their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents once stayed.</p>

      <p>Not far from the old cinema of Legnica, I watched a big plane tree. When I was a little boy, there were big plane trees on both sides of the main street in my hometown. In 1992, because of rebuiding a concrete road, all trees were cut down.</p>

      <p class="image-note">A Building with Reliefs</p>
      <p>I saw some reliefs on the walls of some buildings. The reliefs describe a man riding a horse or an old man playing a parrot. They are different from religious figures or heroic figures. The reliefs make me recall old Chinese buildings. In ancient China, a big family always had elaborate carving figures on their wooden doors, windows and furniture. When I was a little boy, I once passed through a narrow alley. There were some old houses enclosed with walls. I saw some reliefs on the top of high walls. The reliefs also described some traditional figures. Some years later, I became aware that the houses once belonged to my ancestors but my grandparents lost them in 1950s. However, at that time I was not aware that the old buildings would be demolished someday.</p>

      <p>In a cloudy and windy morning, I left Legnica. It seemed that I left my hometown. I dragged my heavy luggage with a heavy heart. I tried to hold back my tears.</p>
