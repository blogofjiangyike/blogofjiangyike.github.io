      <p>Opole is called “the Capital of Polish Song”. Since 1963, Polish people have held an annual music festival here.</p>
      <p>On February 11, I visited the Museum of Polish Song. The museum is very special. Every visitor is given a receiver with an earphone. There are a lot of machines for playing the songs of different styles, periods and singers. When you click a song shown on the screen of a machine, you may listen to it. Each machine can only be for one person at the same time.</p>

      <p>I had been very surprised about pop music in the times of the Polish People’s Republic when I found some Polish songs of 1960s online. In the museum, I had a chance to listen to more pop music at that time.</p>
      <p>When I was very young, I was fond of the songs of the Soviet Union. There were some soft songs like “Uralskaya Ryabinushka”, “Moscow Nights” and “Goodbye Moscow” in the Soviet Union, but they seem to be with folk style. I have never heard that there was pop music in the Soviet Union.</p>

      <p>Though the ideology of the Soviet Union had ruled Polish land for decades, Polish intellectuals were obviously able to resist the culture of the ideology. This was the historical significance of the annual music festival in Opole. During decades, Polish pop music followed the steps of West Europe and the US. It was unimaginable in China at that time.</p>
      <p>Inside the system of the Polish People’s Republic, there should a lot of propaganda songs that adopted folk style like what Russians and Chinese did. After watching a Polish movie “Cold War”, I was fascinated by Polish folk songs, and I bough six albums of the Mazowsze ensemble. The ideology that originated from the Soviet system always needs nationalism as the weapon against the Western world. Sometimes I wonder if some songs of Mazowsze were actually composed in the Polish People’s Republic.</p>

      <p>No matter how the system once tried to do, intellectuals and urban residents had their pop music. You can associate the style of their concerts with the capitalist world, but not with the Soviet system. The pop songs like “Żeby Polska była Polską” and “Mury” became people’s strong cultural weapons at that time. The Soviet system had never successfully changed the culture of Poland.</p>

      <p>More than one thousand years ago, the Poles accepted the Roman Catholic Church and the Kievan Rus accepted the Eastern Orthodox Church. Unlike the East Slavs, the Poles had the tradition of aristocratic democracy. The contest between religious leaders and secular rulers made citizens stronger. And glory to God shook the base of the Soviet system. This is why the Poles had Round Table Talks and later Wałęsa and Jaruzelski became friends. And this is why the Polish way is admirable.</p>
