      <p>I stayed in Poznań from December 15 to December 19, 2022.</p>
      <p>Poznań was one of three Polish cities that I knew in 1990s. My schoolbook of history mentioned 1956 Poznań protests as “Event of Poznań in 1956”.</p>

      <p>I stayed in a hotel located in Old Town of Poznań. I once watched very beautiful pictures about Poznań’s buildings. However, there was a large-scale road reconstruction in Old Town, and the winter was cloudy and cold. It made the trip a little depressed.</p>

      <p>In Poznań, I had a problem of having breakfast. For saving money, I generally do not have breakfast in the restaurant of a hotel. In Gdańsk, the KFC restaurant near the railway station opens at 7 o’clock every morning, and there are some bakeries that open around that time. In Poznań, I had to buy sandwiches in Żabka stores. In the morning of cold winter, Żabka stores said that they did not offer the service of heating food. After I found a bakery, I didn’t buy food in Żabka any more. At that time, I was not familiar with the life of Poland. I once bought an energy drink from a Biedronka store, but didn’t become aware that the ladybug would be my best friend later.</p>

      <p>I was impressed by the winter of Poland. The daytime is very short. Every morning it is dark until eight o’clock, and every afternoon it becomes dark at half past three. In mid-December, I didn’t adapt myself to time difference yet. If I slept in the noon like I always did in China, I would wake until the evening.</p>
      <p>I bought a pair of Wojas shoes. I have worn sneakers for many years. I would like to have a change. However, I twisted my ankle in Poznań. The leather shoes made my ankle more painful. So later I had to put the shoes back to a shoebox. I also bought a pair of leather slippers from a roadside stall. They are the most comfortable slippers that I have ever worn.</p>
